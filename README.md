### Advent of Code:
# Input Collector

## Overview
Quickly gathers you Puzzle Inputs and saves them to their own text files in your chosen folder location.
- Great for if you're slow working on puzzles, like me, leaving you several days behind.
- Also great if you work accross multiple boxes, and are being a good little coder and not sharing your puzzle inputs over source control. :)
- Along side both of the above reasons, very helpful when preparing to work offline.

## Releases
IMPORTANT - Always validate the checksum!
_Checksums will be provided in the release's description._

- [Version 1.0.0 (latest)](https://github.com/AstroClef/AdventOfCode_InputCollector/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

## How To Use
1. Enter the year of the project you'd like puzzle inputs for (The earliest available is 2015).
2. You can then choose a single day or skip and download all available up to the current day for the given year.
3. (_Optional_) Choose if you want Design Validation Testing (DVT) files. **[_See "Special Quirks"_]**
4. Paste in the folder you wish to save your files to.
5. Enter your Advent of Code session ID (Required for your specific puzzle input) - _You will need to dig into your browser cookies for this._
6. Save upto 5 minutes of copying and pasting values.

## Special Quirks
- **Design Validation Testing (DVT) Files**
  - These are just blank files but named uniquely for each day (ex: "Day1_DVT.txt")
  - These files may not be useful to you -- I use these to copy and paste the example input, and I flip between the main text file and the DVT version in my puzzle projects using a simple boolean flag
